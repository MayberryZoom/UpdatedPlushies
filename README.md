# Updated Plushies for Lethal Company
A rewritten and rebalanced version of [Scintesto's Monster Plushies](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Scintesto/Monster_Plushies/) with more configuration options. This mod adds various Lethal Company monsters as scrap in the form of plushies.

By default, the appearance rate of each plushie is loosely based on how common its corresponding monster is on that moon.

Tested up to v73.
